	<h1>Hi there, I'm Jess.</h1>
	<p>I'm interested in ethical AI, sociotechnical systems, and surveillance. My research explores the
	socio-technical aspects of AI and interrogates how different communities engage with, negotiate, or resist 
	AI systems to preserve or advance certain values, including agency, privacy, and free speech. Currently, my
	work is focused on the use of AI in the workplace and in immigration.</p>
