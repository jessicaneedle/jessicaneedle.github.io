	<h1>Hi there, I'm Jess.</h1>
	<p>I'm interested in ethical AI, AI policy, and social informatics. Currently, my research explores the
	socio-technical aspects of AI and interrogates how different communities engage with, negotiate, or resist 
	AI systems to preserve or advance certain values, including agency, privacy, and free speech. For instance, 
	I'm currently doing some work related to the use of AI in in the workplace and immigration.</p>
