	<h1>Hi there, I'm Jess.</h1>
	<p>I'm an Information Studies doctoral student at UT Austin interested in AI ethics, AI policy, 
		and surveillance, advised by Dr. Ken Fleischmann. In my research, I explore the sociotechnical aspects 
		of AI through an interdisciplinary lens, and interrogate how different communities engage with, negotiate, 
		or resist AI systems to preserve or advance human values, such as agency and privacy. My current  work 
		relates to the use of AI in the workplace and immigration. Prior to starting my PhD, I completed an MA in 
		Journalism & Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and spent seven years as marketing 
		strategist in B2B SaaS technology and agency environments. I'm also an <a href="https://ethicalai.utexas.edu/">NSF 
		Research Traineeship Fellow in Ethical AI</a> and researcher for the <a href="https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/projects/making-smart-tools-work-for-everyone">Good Systems, Smart Hand Tools</a> project. </p>
